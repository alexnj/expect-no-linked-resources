# [Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/)

> 01.  What information does this feature expose,
>      and for what purposes?

None. This specification is for a header that an origin outputs to the user agent, for optimizing page loading performance.

 * What information does your spec expose to the first party that the first party cannot currently easily determine: None.
 * What information does your spec expose to third parties that third parties cannot currently easily determine: None
 * What potentially identifying information does your spec expose to the first party that the first party can already access (i.e., what identifying information does your spec duplicate or mirror): None.
 * What potentially identifying information does your spec expose to third parties that third parties can already access: None.

> 02.  Do features in your specification expose the minimum amount of information
>      necessary to implement the intended functionality?

Yes. The feature only exposes the minimum required information, as a boolean header, to satisfy the use case.

> 03.  Do the features in your specification expose personal information,
>      personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from
>      either?

No. The feature does not relate to PII or any derived information thereof.

> 04.  How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information?

No. The feature does not deal with sensitive information.

> 05.  Does data exposed by your specification carry related but distinct
>      information that may not be obvious to users?

Yes. The specification carries related information about the page, specifically if there are linked resources to be expected in the requested page, as a Document-Policy header in the response header, which will not be obvious to users.

> 06.  Do the features in your specification introduce state
>      that persists across browsing sessions?

No. The feature in the specification only applies to a single response and does not persist across browsing session.

> 07.  Do the features in your specification expose information about the
>      underlying platform to origins?

No.

> 08.  Does this specification allow an origin to send data to the underlying
>      platform?

No.

> 09.  Do features in this specification enable access to device sensors?

No.

> 10.  Do features in this specification enable new script execution/loading
>      mechanisms?

No.

> 11.  Do features in this specification allow an origin to access other devices?

No.

> 12.  Do features in this specification allow an origin some measure of control over
>      a user agent's native UI?

No.

> 13.  What temporary identifiers do the features in this specification create or
>      expose to the web?

None.

> 14.  How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and
>      third-party contexts?

It does not differentiate.

> 15.  How do the features in this specification work in the context of a browserâ€™s
>      Private Browsing or Incognito mode?

It does not differentiate.

> 16.  Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
>      Considerations" sections?

No. The feature in the specification does not have any security or privacy impact.

> 17.  Do features in your specification enable origins to downgrade default
>      security protections?

No.

| 2.17. How does your feature handle non-"fully active" documents?

Not applicable. The feature only impacts initial document parsing. It does not interact with anything afterwards.

| 2.18. What should this questionnaire have asked?

None.
